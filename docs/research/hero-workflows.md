# Hero Workflows (Normie‑First)

These are the “aha” tasks that show why a Cowork‑style UI on **pi** matters: English → safe automation on your own files.

## File & Folder Cleanup

1. **Organize Downloads**
   - “Organize my Downloads by type and month, and move old installers into an Archive folder.”

2. **Find & delete duplicates**
   - “Find duplicate files in this folder and move extras to a Duplicates folder.”

3. **Rename based on content**
   - “Rename these PDFs based on their first page title.”

4. **Sort screenshots**
   - “Group screenshots by date and add a short description to each filename.”

5. **Organize photos by date**
   - “Organize these photos into year/month folders.”

## Document & Notes Synthesis

6. **Weekly summary**
   - “Summarize the new docs in this folder into a one‑page weekly report.”

7. **Meeting notes → action list**
   - “Turn these meeting notes into an action list with owners and dates.”

8. **Meeting notes → slide deck**
   - “Turn these meeting notes into a short presentation with 8–10 slides.”

9. **Draft a report**
   - “Write a short report from these notes and sources.”

10. **Research review**
    - “Read these PDFs and give me a 5‑bullet executive summary.”

11. **Notes vault cleanup**
    - “Find orphaned notes and suggest a better folder structure.”

12. **Contract summaries**
    - “Summarize each contract with key terms, renewal dates, and obligations.”

## Data & Tables

13. **Receipts → CSV**
    - “Make a spreadsheet from these receipt photos with date/vendor/amount.”

14. **Invoice PDFs → spreadsheet**
    - “Extract invoice number, date, vendor, and total into a single spreadsheet.”

15. **CSV cleanup**
    - “Clean this CSV: normalize dates and remove duplicate rows.”

16. **Batch CSV cleanup (folder)**
    - “Apply the same cleanup to all CSV files in this folder.”

17. **CSV → chart dashboard**
    - “Create an HTML dashboard from this CSV with 3 key charts.”

## Media & Conversion

18. **Batch convert images**
    - “Convert these images to a single PDF under 10MB.”

19. **Resize/compress**
    - “Compress these videos to be under 50MB each.”

20. **Clip long video → shorts**
    - “Create three 60‑second clips from this video for LinkedIn.”

21. **Rename media**
    - “Rename these photos based on the location metadata.”

## Light Automation / Scripts

22. **Folder monitor summary**
    - “Every Friday, summarize new files added to this folder.”

23. **Template generation**
    - “Create a project folder structure and starter files for a newsletter.”

24. **Personal knowledge cleanup**
    - “Find documents about vendor pricing and put them in a single folder.”

## Writing & Publishing

25. **Blog draft cleanup**
    - “Clean up these drafts, add titles, and create a summary index.”

26. **Style rewrite**
    - “Rewrite these documents to be shorter and more formal.”

27. **Artifact creation**
    - “Make a simple HTML artifact that highlights the key findings.”

## Why These Work

- All tasks are **local file operations** with explicit scope.
- They produce **real artifacts** (CSV, HTML, PDF) instead of chat text.
- They demonstrate **English → automation**, without needing scripting knowledge.
